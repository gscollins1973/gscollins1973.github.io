I am a 125th Anniversary Chair and Professor of Medical Statistics in the Department of Applied Health Sciences at the University of Birmingham. I previously worked at the University of Oxford for 19 years, where I was the Director of the Centre for Statistics in Medicine and made a Professor of Medical Statistics in 2016. In 2024 I was the recipient of a NIHR Senior Investigator award.

STILL VERY MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS
