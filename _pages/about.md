I am a <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/125th-anniversary-fellows-and-chairs">125th Anniversary Chair</a> and Professor of Medical Statistics in the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/about/college-of-medicine-and-health/applied-health-sciences">Department of Applied Health Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/">University of Birmingham</a>. I previously worked at the University of Oxford for 19 years, where I was the Director of the Centre for Statistics in Medicine and made a Professor of Medical Statistics in 2016. 

In 2024 I was the recipient of a <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/people/professor-gary-collins">NIHR Senior Investigator</a> award.

STILL VERY MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS
