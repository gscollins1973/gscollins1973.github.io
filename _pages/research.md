My research interests are primarily focused on methodological aspects in the development and fair evaluation of clinical prediction models (including machine learning) and have published extensively in this area (see <a href="https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/persons/gary-collins/publications/">research output</a> or <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cVKF81gAAAAJ">google scholar</a>). 

SOME MORE BLURB AROUND PREDICTION METHDOLOGY

My other research interests lie in improving the transparency, openness and quality of health research, where I lead the <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/">EQUATOR Network</a> activities in the UK.

In 2010, I established an international initiative to develop the <a href="https://www.tripod-statement.org">TRIPOD</a> reporting recommendations published in <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.g7594">2015</a? for studies developing and validating clinical prediction models. I led an update to these recommendations in 2024 to cover models developed using artificial intelligence and machine learning methods (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078378">TRIPOD+AI</a>) and large language models (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03425-5">TRIPOD-LLM</a>).

I have also been involved in other guidance for artificial intelligence and machine learning studies in healthcare, including

- <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03953-8">STARD-AI</a>: for AI based diagnostic test accuracy studies
- <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj-2022-070904">DECIDE-AI</a>: for early-stage live clinical evaluation of AI systems
- <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1034-x">CONSORT-AI</a> / <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1037-7">SPIRIT-AI</a>: for AI intervention studies
- <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj-2024-083305">CHART</a>: for evaluating chatbots providing medical advice 

I am also involved in development of risk of bias tools for machine learning diagnostic test accuracy studies (QUADAS-AI) and prediction model studies (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj-2024-082505">PROBAST+AI</a>), and the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj-2024-081554">FUTURE-AI</a> principles for trustworthy and deployable artificial intelligence in healthcare.

I have also been involved in the development of numerous other reporting guidelines for other study designs, including the

- <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30388-9/fulltext">GATHER statement</a> for studies providing global health estimates
- <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784353">AGReMA statement</a> for mediation analyses
- 2025 update of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833408">SPIRIT</a> and <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj-2024-081123">CONSORT</a> guidelines for clinical trials
- <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078525">SPIRIT-Surrogate</a> and <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj-2023-078524">CONSORT-Surrogate</a> for trials with surrogate endpoints

I am also a steering group member, and former co-chair of the international <a href="https://stratos-initiative.org/">STRATOS Initiative</a>, which aims to provide accessible and accurate guidance in the design and analysis of observational studies, and I currently sit on the external advisory board for the Centre for Open Science <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines">Transparency and Openness Promotion</a> Guidelines.
